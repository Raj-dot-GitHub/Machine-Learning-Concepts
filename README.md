This repository contains important machine learning concepts explained through blogs, videos, notes, etc. The sections will get updated with new materials regularly. Also this resource list is no way comprehensive. So keeping that in mind let's learn something new!! 

## **Supervised Learning**

#### **Regression Analysis:-**

**In this section of our journey we will learn about a simple but very important use case of machine learning which is Regression Analysis. Below is an ordered list of resources to have an excellent grasp of Regression Techniques. Follow them as it is.**
